# Exercise 4.1

***
# === TASK ===
Write a program that asks the user to enter a series of non-zero integers, one at a time. 

The program should keep asking the user for a number until they enter a value of ``0``. 

The program should then display the average of the numbers that have been entered. 

A good starting point would be The Sum Numbers Program.

For example if ``3`` and ``6.1`` are entered
```
This program calculates the average of a series of numbers entered.
Please enter a number. Enter 0 to stop
3
Please enter a number. Enter 0 to stop
6.1
Please enter a number. Enter 0 to stop
0
The average of the numbers entered is 4.55
```

And if no numbers are entered:
```
This program calculates the average of a series of numbers entered.
Please enter a number. Enter 0 to stop
0
No numbers entered.
```
***Note that to pass the tests you must have exactly the output above, apart from the numbers which will differ depending on what the user inputs.***
