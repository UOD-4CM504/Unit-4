# Exercise 4.4

***
# === TASK ===
Write a program that asks the user for the triangle size they wish to display.

It should then display a triangle created out of asterisks based on the size entered.

For example, for a request of 6, the required output is:

```
Please enter the size (no of rows) of the triangle you wish to display:
6
*
**
***
****
*****
******
```

HINT: You can repeat a string by multiplying it. e.g.
```python
print("hello"*3)
```
outputs:
```
hellohellohello
```
OR you can stop python printing a newline using the ``end`` parameter. e.g.

```python
print("hello", end="")
print("hello", end="")
print("hello", end="")
```
also outputs:
```
hellohellohello
```

If you want to challenge yourself, the second way is harder.

***Note that to pass the tests you must have exactly the output above, apart from the numbers which will differ depending on what the user inputs.***
